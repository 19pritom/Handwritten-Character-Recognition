# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
In this project, we aim to create a handwriting recognition system that uses deep learning to accurately recognize handwritten text. The dataset used comprises 26 classes, each representing a letter of the English alphabet. We proposed a  model that  achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.69% .
